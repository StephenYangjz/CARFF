# CARFF NeRF Decoder

This folder is the NeRF decoder implementation based on the pytorch implementation of [instant-ngp](https://github.com/NVlabs/instant-ngp), as described in [_Instant Neural Graphics Primitives with a Multiresolution Hash Encoding_](https://nvlabs.github.io/instant-ngp/assets/mueller2022instant.pdf).

### Install with conda
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate torch-ngp
```

### Raymarching import errors
If the error or similar errors detailed in this [GitHub issue](https://github.com/ashawkey/torch-ngp/issues/184) appears, navigate to `raymarching/backend.py` and change all instances of `c++14` to `c++17`.


# Usage

We use the same data format as instant-ngp, e.g., [armadillo](https://github.com/NVlabs/instant-ngp/blob/master/data/sdf/armadillo.obj) and [fox](https://github.com/NVlabs/instant-ngp/tree/master/data/nerf/fox). 
Please download and put them under `./data`.

First time running will take some time to compile the CUDA extensions.

```bash
python main_nerf.py path/to/data --workspace workspace_name
```
